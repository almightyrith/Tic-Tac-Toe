## Features
**Functional Decomposition:** The program uses methods to organize and separate different functionalities, making the code modular and easier to maintain.

**Looping with Repetition Control Structures:** It utilizes looping structures such as for and while loops for game logic and input validation.

**Branching with Selection Control Structures:** Conditional statements like if/else are used to determine the game state and make decisions.

**File IO:** While not directly implemented in the game, this project can be expanded to include saving and loading game states to/from files.

**Formatted Output:** The program uses formatted output to display the game board in a clear and organized manner.

**Using Multiple Classes:** The game is structured with multiple classes, including a main driver class and classes for game logic and user input.

**1-D Arrays:** Arrays are used to represent the game board and track player moves.

**Class Design using Constructors and Access Modifiers:** Classes are designed with constructors and private instance variables, with getter and setter methods for data access.

This project is intended to be a practice exercise for using GitHub for version control and collaboration. Feel free to explore and modify this Tic Tac Toe game, add new features, improve the user interface, or enhance the game logic.
